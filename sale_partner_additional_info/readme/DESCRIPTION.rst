This module does the following:

- Adds Additional Information fields (1-3) to the partner model, whose values should
  show in printed sales orders / invoices.
- Adjust the address presentation of partners in printed sales orders / invoices (i.e.
  show phone), since, by default, there are cases where phone does not show together with
  the address in printed documents.

Additional Information fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These fields are intended to keep required particulars to show on business documents
(particularly export documents) to comply with regulations or acknowledged
conventions/standards.
